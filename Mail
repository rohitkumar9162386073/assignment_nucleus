Give me a mail asking a leave for my examination and college project from my manager Neelam ma'am 

Subject: Request for Leave for Examination and College Project

Dear Neelam Ma'am,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a leave of absence from work for the period of May 15th to May 30th, 2023.

As you are aware, I am pursuing a college course alongside my job. The final examinations for the same are scheduled to take place during the aforementioned period. Additionally, I also have a major college project that requires my attention during this time.

Therefore, I kindly request you to grant me a leave of absence for the mentioned period. I assure you that I will complete all my pending work before the leave period and will also ensure that there is no disruption to the workflow of our team.

I am available to discuss any concerns you may have and am willing to work on any alternative solutions that you may suggest.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
